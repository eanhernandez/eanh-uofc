1.4 The myfile is simply a file containing the text I put in it.
The soft_link is a symbolic link, and is a pointer to myfile:wq.  It is
smaller than the other files, because it merely points to the filename
of myfile.  The hard_link file is the same size as myfile because it
points to the same inode that myfile points to, and is literally another 
name for the data that myfile points to.
