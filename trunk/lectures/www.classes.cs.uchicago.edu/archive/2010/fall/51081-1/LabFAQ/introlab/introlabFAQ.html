Basically, there are   several file systems linked together by a network, run by a single host which stores a database of   configuration information (such as your login name, password, and default shell) and distributes this  to other machines in the system. This allows some consistency   across all machines in the network.  To access information   on this system you need special commands. Many look like ordinarly unix commands   with a prefix <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">yp</font>. For example,   <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ypcat</font> will print the data from a database to the screen   (like <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cat</font>.)   The database we want is named <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">passwd</font>.  Try <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ypcat passwd | head -25 </font><br>The command <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">head</font> displays the first few lines of data:  the default is ten line, but the option <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-25</font> displays 25 line.   FYI the prefix <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">yp</font> refers to Sun Yellow Pages which was the former name of the service providing the network distribution:  Network Information System (NIS).</p></body></html>
