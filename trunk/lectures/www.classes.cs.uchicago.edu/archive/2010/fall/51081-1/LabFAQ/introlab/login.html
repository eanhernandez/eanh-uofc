Three topics are covered:<ul><li><a href="#software">Software</a></li><li><a href="#logging">Logging In</a></li><li><a href="#">Transferring Files</a></li></ul><a name="software"></a><h2>Obtaining Software</h2><p> Secure SHell (ssh) is a protocol for logging into a remote machine and for   executing commands on a remote machine. There is also a command in Unix <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssh</font>   which implements this protocol. You will find useful information for installing   a program which will allow you remote access on the department's machines on   the Computer Science website, <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/info/services/ssh">SSH</a>.   On this website you will find a hyperlink that will allow you access to a CS   machine, or to the university wide Harper machine.</p>    <a name="logging"></a>  <h2>Logging In</h2><p> Once you have the software you need to know the name of a machine to log onto.   You will find a long list of machines at  <a href="http://stuff.cs.uchicago.edu/searchresults/alive_hrs/1/os_name/Linux/net_group_list/cs_users_cppcs">  machines</a> for the CSPP program.</p>   <p>  Now you are ready to login.  If you are using Unix or Linux, you can login to a remote machine by<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssh -l </font><em>name</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>machine</em><br>You may recieve the <a name="message">message</a> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The authenticity of host 'abyss.cs.uchicago.edu (148.331.7.724)' can't be established . . .</font><br> and a prompt asking if you would like to continue.  Type yes, and you should be prompted for your user name then password.  If this checks out you will be given the prompt for the machine you requested  </p>    <a name="transfer"></a>  <h2>Transferring files</h2>   <p>  At some point you'll want to transfer files from your home machine to a host machine.  You do not need  to login to the host machine.  You will use a program for copying files between remote machines.  The  name of the Unix program is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scp</font>.  On your home computer, the  program you use to login will have additional support for transferring files.  You will need to know the   name of the remote machine you wish to transfer files with.  You will find a long list of machines at  <a href="http://stuff.cs.uchicago.edu/searchresults/alive_hrs/1/os_name/Linux/net_group_list/cs_users_cppcs">  machines</a> for the CSPP program.  </p>    <p>  Suppose you want to transfer a file <em>from</em> your home machine to a remote machine.  On your home  machine you can follow the directions of your remote connection software.  If you are on a Unix or Linux  machine you will use the following command line will transfer a file from your home machine to a  remote machine into your home directory on that remote machine:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scp &nbsp; file  &nbsp;</font>     <em>username@remote_machine</em><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">:~</font><br>The response will be a prompt for your user name (or a <a href="#message">message</a>.)  Be aware:  you needthe colon (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">:</font>) separating <em>username@remote_machine</em> fromthe destination of the file, in this case, your home directory (signified by <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">~</font>.)	 You may replace <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">~</font> by any other location you want for your file.  </p><p>  Suppose you want to transfer a file <em>to</em> your home machine from a remote machine.    If you are on a Unix or Linux  machine you will use the following command line to transfer <em>file</em> to your home machine from a  remote machine into <em>location</em> on your home machine:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scp &nbsp;</font>   <em>username@remote_machine</em><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">:</font><em>file</em>&nbsp;    <em>location</em> &nbsp;<br>  The response will be a prompt for your user name (or a <a href="#message">message</a>.)   Be aware: you need the colon (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">:</font>)   separating <em>username@remote_machine</em> from the source <em>file</em>.	 </p> <p> If you want to transfer <em>directories</em> you will need to include an option:    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">scp -r</font>.  The rest of the command line is the same as for  transferring files.  </p></body></html>
