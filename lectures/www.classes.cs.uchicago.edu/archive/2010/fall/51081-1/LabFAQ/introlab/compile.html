This page is intended for people whowant to practice programming C now.  This material will be greatly supplemented later in the course.<br><h2>Compiling your program on Unix</h2><p>The Unix command for compiling C code is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gcc</font>.  This is a compilerfrom Gnu for Linux. If you are using a Unix machine like Solaris you may need to use the command <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cc</font>.)  When you compile your program the compiler produces a filecontaining  binary code which is directly readable by the machine you are on.  This file is called an<em>executable</em> file, because it can be executed by the machine.  But this executable file may notbe readable on other machines.  ANY program you want to run on a department machine, you should compile on a department machine.  DO NOT transfer the executable file from one machine to another.  It is best to recompile the code.</p><p>Suppose you have a file <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">hello.c</font> whichyou want to compile (or use <a href="hello.c">hello.c</a>.)Type the following on the command line<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gcc hello.c</font><br>If no error messages were printed to the screen, your code compiled.  Now do<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ls</font> and you will see a file called<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> a.out</font>.  By default, <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gcc</font> places the executable into this file, overwriting anyexisting file of the same name.  You specify the name of your executable, say  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">hello</font> by the following line:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gcc hello.c &nbsp;-o hello</font><br>If your code compiled you will see the file <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">hello</font> in yourdirectory.  It is that easy.	</p><p>To run your file, you need to make sure that the user file permission for that file is set to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">x</font> for executable.  Just type the name of your executable on the command line:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> hello</font><br>If you happen to recieve a message from the shell that it cannot find the file, then you will need to type: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">./hello</font><br>	What happened is that when you type a command, the shell has to look for the executable to run the 	command.  It does not assume that the executable resides in your home directory.  In fact it has a very	specific order of directories in which it looks for executables.  If it does not find the executable in	any of these it gives up its search.  It may be that your shell is not set-up to look in your current	directory.  By typing <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">./hello</font> you are telling the shell	exactly where to go to find the executable:  your current directory (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">.</font>).  You can see the search path using the shell variable <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">$PATH</font>,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">echo $PATH</font><br>what you will see is a colon-separated list of directories.  The shell searches these directories from left-to-right.  For example, on my current machine I recieved<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/home/kaharris/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/include:.</font><br>The last directory searched is my current directory. 	 	</p></body></html>
