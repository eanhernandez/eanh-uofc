At thisstage your biggest obstacle is ignorance, a rather undaunting obstacle to overcome!!So, to begin you must break down your task into smaller problems, by replacing the question <strong>Where do I begin</strong>?, with four questions which will definethe way you attack your problem:</p><ol>	<li><strong>What do I need to do to complete this task?</strong></li>	<li><strong>How can it get done?</strong></li>	<li><strong>Can I get the computer to do this?</strong></li>	<li><strong>How can I make my solution better?</strong></li></ol><p>I encourage you to take a look at Bruce Molay's <em>Understanding Unix/Linux Programming</em> where he implements this philosophy.  The first of the three questions are introduced in section 1.3.3 (p. 7) and the final question in section 2.6.4 (p. 55). I will consider each question below. </p> <h2>What do I need to do to complete this task?</h2><p>Your first hurdle is the problem of circumscribing <em>exactly</em> what your task is.If your lucky someone else has completely solved this problem, but invariably you willneed to give some thought here.  The primary point to remember is that you do not wantto overburden the rest of your effort by trying to do too much too soon.  This is the reason that I introduced the fourth question above:  <strong>How can I make my solution better?</strong>What is the minimum your program will need to do, to solve the task?  You may need to simplify this problem further, by setting a more modest goal, then build from there.At this stage there are three questions you will want to address:</p><ul>	<li>What input values will my program accept?</li>	<li>What output value will be given, and what is its connection with		 the input values?</li>	<li>How can things go wrong?</li>	 </ul> <p>This final question will probably be rather difficult to answer at this stage, but it isgood to think about the ways a program can go wrong:<ul>	<li>What happens if too few input items are given?</li>	<li>What happens if too many input items are given?</li>	<li>Are there some inputs in the range of possible values which could			could cause trouble?</li></ul>As your project proceeds, it will become clearer how things can go wrong, and whatsteps you need to take to make sure your program can backout, gently.</p><h2><strong>How can it get done?</strong></h2><p>The aim at this stage is to work through the <em>logic</em> of your program.  Whatsteps will your program have to take between its recieving the input values and itsreturning the output values?  What is the order that they must be performed?:<ul>	<li>Break your single task into several <em>conceptually</em> simpler tasks</li>	<li>Determine the order to perform the tasks to ensure the program			returns a correct value.</li></ul></p><p>Your goal at this stage is to <em>conceptually</em> simplify your task, by breaking itdown into subtasks.  You should not be concerned that what is <em>conceptually</em> simplemay be rather difficult to program; later, when you address the question<strong>Can I get the computer to do this?</strong> you may need to come backand answer the question for this new task.</p><p>Once you have broken down your one task into several, you need to determine the correctorder to perform each task.  If you have had Algorithms, you might think of this stage aspreparing pseudocode; but even a flow diagram is sufficient.  You will find a couple ofexamples from Mollay's book on pages 20 (for <strong>more</strong>) and 48 (for<strong>who</strong>).  </p><p>You now have a template for your program.  At this point, I open up my text editor andtype in my template (if your program is in C, you can add the <strong>main</strong>function, or any other opening statements that are required.)  You are ready to program!!</p><h2><strong>Can I get the computer to do this?</strong></h2><p>Now that you have a template, you can fill it out with your program.  A fatal mistakeis to try to fill in your program, then debug it. Use your template wisely.  It is both aguide for your code, and a guide for your testing.  If you are like me, you willspend more time debugging code then researching and writing it.  Debugging is greatly simplified when the code that requires it is smaller.  With this in mind, there arethree steps to filling in you template:<ul>	<li>Research what commands you need to perform the task.</li>	<li>Write the code.</li>	<li>Test the code.</li></ul></p><p>You have many resources available to you for researching the functions the language placesat your disposal. What you should keep in mind is the particular task you want to perform.  Unfortunately, many functions pack in alot of functionality which is not goingto be required.  Do not bog down on details that you do not need.  But make sure you haveall the details you do need!!!  For each function that may be of value I make a table of relevant information:</p><table width="75%" border="1" align="center">  <tr>  	<td align="center"> Function Name</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">Purpose</td>    <td>What the Function does which is relevant to your task</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">Include</td>    <td>Header files you will need</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">Usage</td>    <td>Function prototype (the function's syntax)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">Arguments</td>    <td>The appropriate range of values for each argument (at least			include those values which are appropriate to your task)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">ReturnValue</td>    <td>Function's return value (pay special care to note the return			value on error)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top">Errors</td>    <td>The possible causes of errors (this is closely related to the range of			acceptable values for each argument)</td>  </tr></table><p>The purpose of this table is <strong>not</strong> to include <em>everything</em> thefunction does, but only what is relevant to your task.  This means that what you needunder <strong>Purpose</strong>, <strong>Arguments</strong>, <strong>ReturnValue</strong>,and <strong>Errors</strong> should be limited to what you expect to need.  You will find an example of this style in Mollay's book (for example, p. 41 for<strong>open</strong>.)</p><p>I recommend you write the code for each task and test that code separately.   It will be simpler to debug your code; but it also serves the purpose that  you can play withunfamiliar functions.  It will also give you some extra time to think about your  code, and may lead to ways of simplifying the code you write. You should also  be aware that yourtemplate may not be as finely detailed as will be useful.  Often a <em>conceptually</em>simple task requires a bit of code to perform.  You may need to re-ask<strong>How can it get done?</strong>.</p><h2><strong>How can I make my solution better?</strong></h2><p>By this stage you have a working program, but it might not do everything that is required of it (especially, if you simplified your task when answering<strong>What do I need to do to complete this task?</strong>.)  Even if your programdoes everything you set out to do, since you have been thinking hard about your task,you probably have come upon ways of extending your program. Don't stop short. This is where the real fun begins!!!   </p></body></html>
